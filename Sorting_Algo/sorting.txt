Sorting -> 1) Space-used ( 1) In-Pace, 2) Out-of-Space ), 
		   2) Stability ( 1) Stable, 2) Unstable )
In-Pace Sorting : Sorting algorithm which does not required extra space for sorting
				  Ex: Bubble Sort
In-Pace Sorting : Sorting algorithm which required extra space for sorting
				  Ex: Merge Sort

Stable Sorting : If a sorting algorithm after sorting the content does not change
				 the sequence of similar content in which they appear, 
				 then this sorting is called stable sorting.
				 Ex: Insertion Sorting
Unstable Sorting : If a sorting algorithm after sorting the content changes
				 the sequence of similar content in which they appear, 
				 then this sorting is called stable sorting.
				 Ex: Quick Sorting
